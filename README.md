# My story [Is this path suitable for You ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]

My journey began with robotics when I began studying electronics, design, and C programming for problem-solving and kit programming (Arduino, Raspberry pi,‚Äîetc)   

in addition I studied Computer Science Principles (CS50) Course from HarvardX   

#### Then I Asked myself what is the Career I will Join ‚ùì 
I chose to become a Computer Vision Engineer for Autonomous Robots [this is only a Starting Imagination We don't know what will happen During the Journey So Let's Only Start] .  

 I began studying image processing,python and differant things I found on Youtube 

### The Problem ‚ö†Ô∏è 
I want a small path because I want to Earn Money and also I Want to Learn then I made my Search about Companies Requirments for Putting the path and Also I Made a market research for knowing more about the best paying categories I can earn

After EveryStep I take in My Learning Journey I can Work with it as a Freelancer or Making a Small Business Using it (For Practicing , Learning More and Earning Money)

### Positions I can to Get by the order during my Journey üßç

1- Python Developer   
2- Data Engineer   
3- Data Analyst   
4- Machine Learning Engineer   
5- Data Scientist
